    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Lasanga</strong> is a classic Italian dish made with layers of
      pasta sheets, rich meat or vegetable sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta
      cheese, and gooey melted cheese on top. Baked to perfection, this hearty
      dish boasts a perfect balance of flavors—savory, cheesy, and slightly
      tangy from the tomato sauce. Whether made with traditional Bolognese,
      spinach and ricotta, or a plant-based filling, lasagna is a comforting
      meal enjoyed worldwide. Serve it hot with a side of garlic bread and a
      fresh salad for a complete, satisfying feast!
